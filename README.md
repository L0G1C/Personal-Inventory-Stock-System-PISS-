# PISS
Personal Inventory &amp; Stock System

Users keep track of items in their home by creating their own PISS Bucket and defining the item types that will go in.

Books might have an ISBN, a title, an author.

Movies might have an IMDB rating, a title, a director and cast members

Games might have a GamerBomb rating, a title, a studio, a console, etc.

All of these things are items, and the future defines what parts each item needs, then keeps track of how many of these items 
they have in their home, by creating them and putting them right into their dedicated PISS bucket!
